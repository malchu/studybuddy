## Introduction
The goal of this app is to allow users to create flashcards that they can save and review, akin to Quizlet.
### Key Functionality
Upon booting up the app for the first time, the user should be asked to sign in using Google. After signing in, they can either make a new set of flashcards or review their previous sets (presented with two different buttons). If they choose to make a new set of flashcards, they are led to a screen where there is a button to add an empty flashcard to the set. Once they add it, there are two lines on the empty flash card: one for the term, one for the definition. Each flashcard added will also have a button on it to delete it. The user can keep adding and editing the flash cards. Once they exit the activity, their set is saved and can be reviewed by navigating to the userâ€™s flash cards from the navigation menu. They can click on their set and can navigate through each card using arrows on the screen. Tapping on the flash card flips it to the definition.
